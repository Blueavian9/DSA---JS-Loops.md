# JS-Loops.md: Types of Loops practice in JavaScript 

JavaScript Loops in index.js file
This file showcases different types of loops in JavaScript, each useful for various iteration needs. Below is a brief description of each type of loop:

## 1. For Loop
The for loop is used to run a block of code a specified number of times. It’s most commonly applied when the number of iterations is known in advance.

## 2. While Loop
The while loop continues executing a code block as long as the given condition is true. It is typically used when the number of iterations depends on a condition that may change during execution.

## 3. Do While Loop
The do while loop guarantees that the block of code will run at least once before the condition is checked. After the first execution, it will continue to loop as long as the condition is true.

## 4. ForEach Loop
The forEach loop is specific to arrays, executing a provided function once for each array element. It’s a more concise way to iterate over array elements compared to traditional loops.

## 5. Map Method
The map method applies a function to every element in an array and returns a new array with the results. Unlike forEach, it does not modify the original array but instead creates a transformed copy.
